                <p>
                    When I'm not studying or working, I love to hike and travel with
                    my sister. We are currently working our way through all of the National
                    Parks. On our most recent trip, we visited Zion National Park in Utah. 
                    We also won a lottery to hike The Wave in the Coyote Buttes in Arizona.

                <h2>Pets</h2>
                <p>
                    Another pastime of mine, is training my dog. I have a 2 year old Border 
                    Collie, named Gadget, that I am training to be my hiking partner. I 
                    also hope that he will become an agility competitor. He's full of energy
                    and smarter than me, which definitely keeps me on my toes.

                    For the last five years or so, I have been working
                    as an Interior Designer and Interior Architect. While
                    I absolutely loved my work and the variety that came with
                    it; I wanted better job prospects and longevity in the future.
                    I decided that pursuing a career in tech might just be the answer
                    I was looking for. In college, I had an interest in web development,
                    but didn't know how to go about pursuing it. I am excited to see
                    where this new journey takes me.
